## Lessons Learned

There were some challenges in this that I still am not 100% confident in understanding. The biggest challenge was getting the battery status to update dynamically. I am still not fully sure I understand how it is working, but I got it in the end. I will admit that I used chatGPT to start to get an understanding, and while I used AI I still wrote the code myself first and got it to check when I ran into roadblocks.

Another challenge was getting the browser name. I originally tried to use a switch statement, but ran into too many difficulties so defaulted to a rather long and arduous if-else statement. It is not very pretty, but it functions. If there are any suggestions to how I could run that better, I would love to hear them
